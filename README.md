### 4 Waterfalls and a 200 year old cemetery; A scenic hike for all ages in Dupont State forest

For this project I was inspired by the hikes and mountainbiking rides I have been on while living in Etowah, NC, a stones throw from Dupont State Forest. Many times I have been on this exact hike and each time it was as fun as the last. This hike is also well suited for beginner mountainbikers and older hikers as the slopes are not so steep and the trail is nice and flat.

This hike is roughly a 1 and a half hour walk not including the amount of time stopped. It is also just 4.3 miles as indicated from my data source, Google maps, which is a good start for a beginner mountainbiker who maybe isn't quite fit yet. I can attest to that as when I first started mountainbiking this was a decent ride and didn't leave me too tired.

For the about section of the map I simply wrote from experience and referred to the article by [Lauren Step](https://thelaurelofasheville.com/communities/history-feature-telling-the-tales-of-duponts-deceased/) for facts about Thomas Cemetery.
